# Handong Global University Sleep Over Macro

## This is HGU Sleep over macro version 1.0.0

### You can sign up for a sleepover using this program. 

You need to enter the "hisnet" id and password. Then, type the venue and purpose of the sleepover. 
The format will be "venue" 에서 "purpose."

If you edit the source code, you may put the parameter permanently. It is up to you. 

I and SB have more ideas about it; please wait for a more updated version.
